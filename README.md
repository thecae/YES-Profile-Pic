# YES-Profile-Pic
This is a simple program that allows users of [YES](https://yes.vanderbilt.edu) to alter the site to display an image of their choice as their profile image. It functions as a Google Chrome extension.

# Requirements
The code requires that the image be a 265x305px image that is put in the assets/images folder.  It can also be done by using a URL link to the image placed inside the code.

***Note**: This code does not actually change the profile image, but rather changes the appearance of the website.*
